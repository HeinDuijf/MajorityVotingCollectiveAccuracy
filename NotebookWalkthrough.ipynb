    "# Majority Voting and Collective Accuracy\n",
    "This jupyter notebook demonstrates how the [agent-based model](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7767124) of majority voting works by walking you through the stages of the model. The agent-based model is an adaptation of the Condorcetian framework (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet%27s_jury_theorem) or [The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2023/entries/jury-theorems/)) which operationalizes the following (revised) assumptions:\n",
    "1. **The Assumption of Plural Interests.** For each agent, there exists some agent-relative measure of success or correctness – typically referred to as the agent’s interest or values. \n",
    "2.\t**The Group-relative Competence Assumption.** For each of the two groups (masses and elites), each member’s belief about the right alternative is true with probability greater than chance level.\n",
    "3. **The Social Influence Assumption.** (a) The initial beliefs of all voters are probabilistically independent (given the true state of the world). (b) The final beliefs of voters can be influenced by other voters. \n",
    "4. **The Sincerity Assumption.** All voters vote for the alternative they believe to be the right alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, an instantiation of the agent-based model, called `Community`, consists of the following building blocks:\n",
    "- A set of agents $N$,\n",
    "- A partition of $N$ into elites $E$ and masses $M$,\n",
    "- Group-relative competences $p_e$ and $p_m$ (in $[0,1]$) for elites and masses, respectively,\n",
    "- For each agent $i \\in N$:\n",
    "    - Her membership in either the elites ($E$) or the masses ($M$),\n",
    "    - Her individual competence $p_i\\in [0,1]$ (which equals either $p_e$ or $p_m$, depending on the group she belongs to)\n",
    "    - Her social environment $S_i \\subseteq N$."

    "Let us start with considering a simple example of a community with only 20 agents. More explicitly, we set the parameters as follows:\n",
    "- A set of agents $N=\\{0, \\ldots, 19\\}$,\n",
    "- A partition of $N$ into elites $E=\\{0, \\ldots, 7\\}$ (hence $|E|=6$) and masses $M=\\{8, \\ldots, 19\\}$,\n",
    "- Group-relative competences $p_e=0.8$ and $p_m=0.6$ for elites and masses, respectively,\n",
    "- For each agent $i \\in N$:\n",
    "    - Her social environment $S_i \\subseteq N$ (where $|S_i|=6$). \n",
    "\n",
    "The simple community is depicted in the picture below. Let me explain the picture:\n",
    "- Nodes:\n",
    "    - The color of the nodes represents whether they are <font color=\"#FFC107\">elites</font> or <font color=\"#9C27B0\">masses</font>.\n",
    "    - The size is proportional to the in-degree, so that bigger nodes are more influential. In general, influential nodes are in the center of the picture.\n",
    "    - As a rule of thumb, the elites are more prone to be on the left-hand side of the network, while the masses are on the right-hand side. \n",
    "- Edges:\n",
    "    - The *edges* represent the agents' **social environments**: the social environment of an agent is the set of target nodes of all outgoing edges. Accordingly, every node has out-degree 6.\n",
    "    - The color of the edges represents whether the target nodes are <font color=\"#FFC107\">elites</font> or <font color=\"#9C27B0\">masses</font>.\n",
    "    - The network that is generated using preferential attachment and homophilic selection ($h$=0.7), but this is hardly visible in such small-scale communities.\n",
    "    \n",
    "All the pictures are **interactive**: you can move nodes around!"
