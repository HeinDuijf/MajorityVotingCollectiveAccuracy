    "# Majority voting\n",
    "This jupyter notebook demonstrates how the [agent-based model](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7767125) of majority voting works by walking you through the stages of the model. The agent-based model is basically an adaptation from the Condorcetian framework (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet%27s_jury_theorem) or [The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2023/entries/jury-theorems/)) which operationalizes the following assumptions:\n",
    "1. **The Assumption of Plural Interests.** For each agent, there exists some agent-relative measure of success or correctness – typically referred to as the agent’s interest or values. \n",
    "2.\t**The Group-relative Competence Assumption.** For each of the two groups (masses and elites), each member’s belief about the right alternative is true with probability greater than chance level.\n",
    "3. **The Social Influence Assumption.** (a) The initial beliefs of all voters are probabilistically independent (given the true state of the world). (b) The final beliefs of voters can be influenced by other voters. \n",
    "4. **The Sincerity Assumption.** All voters vote for the alternative they believe to be the right alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, an instantiation of the agent-based model, called `Community`, consists of the following building blocks:\n",
    "- A set of agents $N$,\n",
    "- A partition of $N$ into elites $E$ and masses $M$,\n",
    "- Group-relative competences $p_e$ and $p_m$ (in $[0,1]$) for elites and masses, respectively,\n",
    "- For each agent $i \\in N$:\n",
    "    - Her membership in either the elites ($E$) or the masses ($M$),\n",
    "    - Her individual competence $p_i\\in [0,1]$ (which equals either $p_e$ or $p_m$, depending on the group she belongs to)\n",
    "    - Her social environment $S_i \\subseteq N$."
